## Roboticist 
Hi, I am Christopher, a PhD student robotics researcher at USU. My expertise is in both data science and robotic intelligence. With experience as a software engineer, I have a passion for building autonomous systems and computer vision applications. I have worked extensively with both wheeled and dynamic quadruped robots to achieve successful research goals.
