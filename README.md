## Roboticist 
I focus on intelligent robotics, and my current research aims to improve the robustness and dependability of planning and adaptability for applied robotic systems.
I'm fascinated by the possibilities of Intelligent Robotics. Robotics has been a hobby of mine even before I participated in the FIRST Robotics Challenge in high school. From my industry experience, I am interested in the need for more complex decision and reasoning in mechatronic systems. Rapid innovations in GPU technology and machine learning have the potential to provide quicker flexibility, more competent decision making, and real-time scene analysis. I aim to understand and use this advancement in computer technology to create new and improved algorithms for robot intelligence.
